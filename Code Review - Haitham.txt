
1- This controller is too big and you must split it to smaller functions and classes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2- There are many imports in this file.
   These imports can be replaced and exported in another file, and this file will be imported here.
   This will make the code cleaner and more readable.
   The imports can be exported in a file called 'streak_imports.dart' and imported here.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3- It is best to create a file for fixed / static values ​​in the application.
   This file can be called 'app_constants.dart' and all fixed values ​​in the application can be added to it.
   This will make the code cleaner and more readable.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4- There is a security issue and should be fixed (_lastSyncedHashStreaksKey && downloadUrl).
   It is wrong to pass any keys or endpoints directly inside the code.
   It is best to create a file for all endpoints in the application.
   The right way is to create a '.env' file and add these keys in it.
   - String get downloadUrl => 'https://api/download'.
   The '.env' file should be read in the main.dart file and the keys should be passed to the controllers or services that need them.
   The .env file should be added to .gitignore file to avoid pushing it to the repository.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5- We noticed that the translation is not working properly, we need to check the translation file and make sure that the translation is correct.
   You can create a file called 'app_translations.dart' and add all translation strings to it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6- The _calcStreaks function is too long and contains many variables and calculations.
   It is best to split this function into smaller functions and group them in a separate file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7- It is best to create a file contains all shared functions.
   This file can be called 'shared_functions.dart' and all shared functions can be added to it.
   The shared functions can be added to it and imported in the files that need them.
   It will be easier to maintain and update these functions and make the controller easier and readable.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8- BorderRadiusGeometry && Colors && DateTime.
   It is best to create an Extensions file and add all extensions to it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9- The share function can be added to the separated 'shared_functions.dart' file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10- The imageShare widget must be added to a separate file.
    We can create a new statless widget called 'ImageShareWidget' and pass the params to it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11- _deleteCachedFile() && clear() functions can be added to the cache service.
    It is best to create a file called 'cache_service.dart' and add all cache functions to it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, We can add some general tips and suggestions for improvement: 
 - Add unit tests
 - Separate the UI from the business logic
 - Separate the controller to smaller functions and classes
 - Review all existing functions and rewrite them in a way that suits clean code and apply clean arch principles
 - Add comments to the code to make it easier to understand
